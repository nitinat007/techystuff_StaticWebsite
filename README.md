# techystuff_StaticWebsite
Hosted my staging website on Github. 
You can access it on http://techystuff.ml/ or https://nitinat007.github.io/techystuff_StaticWebsite

WordPress website is converted to static pages and pushed to github (gh-pages branch in techystuff_StaticWebsite) using WP2Static plugin.
Created free domain from https://my.freenom.com/ and redirected the requests from http://techystuff.ml/ to https://nitinat007.github.io/techystuff_StaticWebsite
. The site will miss dynamic interaction like plugins, searchbar, email contacts etc
